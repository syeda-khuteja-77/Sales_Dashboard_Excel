# Sales Analysis Dashboard – Excel Project

This project presents a **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built in Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of key sales metrics to help understand business performance, revenue trends, product movement, and customer behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Sales Dashboard was developed from a raw sales dataset that required proper preprocessing, summarization, and visualization.
The final output is an **interactive Excel dashboard** powered by PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and clean UI design for a smooth analytical experience.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The dataset was cleaned and prepared to ensure accurate insights:

* Identified and handled **missing values**
* Corrected data formats (dates, numbers, categories)
* Removed duplicates and inconsistencies
* Standardized categories for uniform reporting
* Ensured proper structure for PivotTable summarization

This step prepared the dataset for reliable and meaningful analysis.

## 📊 Data Analysis

After cleaning the data, multiple PivotTables were created to extract key insights.
The analysis included:

* Revenue breakdown by product, region, and category
* Sales trends across months/quarters
* Customer-wise and segment-wise performance
* Top-selling and low-performing products
* Profitability distribution
* Quantity sold and sales contribution analysis

These summaries served as the backbone for the dashboard visuals.

## 📈 Dashboard Creation

The dashboard includes multiple visual elements such as:

* Column and bar charts
* Line charts for trend analysis
* Category-wise and region-wise performance visuals
* Product contribution charts
* KPIs and summary cards (like total sales, profit, top product, etc.)

To enhance interactivity, **slicers** were added for dynamic filtering based on:

* Region
* Product Category
* Salesperson / Customer
* Time Period
* Product Name

This allows users to drill down into specific insights quickly and intuitively.
